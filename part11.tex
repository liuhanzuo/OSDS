\begin{homeworkProblem}[Throughput Analyzis]

We test the throughputs under different values of working threads \& queue lengths. See Figure 1 \& 2.

We conclude that

\begin{itemize}
    \item In general throughput grows when there are more threads, but the growth is sublinear. The reason can be that there are more context switches.
    \item When the queue is of size 1 the throughput is $\bold{surprisingly\ high}$, even higher than the case when the queue is of maximum capable length. We do not know the specific reason. For the rest cases the throughput grows slowly with queue length (the shape of the curve looks like logarithm).
\end{itemize}
\end{homeworkProblem}

\begin{homeworkProblem}[Latency Analyzis]
    We plot the latency distribution for the case \# of Threads = Queue Length = 300.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{fig/latency.png}
    \caption{Latency Distribution, 3000 Threads Enqueue / Dequeue Each, Queue Length = 3000.}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{fig/small_latency.png}
    \caption{Latency Distribution, 3000 Threads Enqueue / Dequeue Each, Queue Length = 300.}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{fig/smaller_latency.png}
    \caption{Latency Distribution, 30000 Threads Enqueue / Dequeue Each, Queue Length = 30000.}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

(In the above 3 charts largest 1$\%$ of entries are removed to make the plot elegant.)

We conclude that

\begin{itemize}
    \item Small queue lengths make latency much larger. We see that when queue length matches \# of threads $99\%$ of all operations are finished in microseconds, while most can be finished within nanoseconds. However when length is only 1/10 of number of threads there is about 1/10 of queries taking 1 ms or even higher.
    \item Number of threads do not affect latency distribution much.
\end{itemize}
